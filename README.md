###### tags: `Tableau` `2019.4` `BizCafe`


## üìù What is the Coffee Shop Data Analysis?
> The following tableau file analyzes data collected from a virtual coffee shop simulation. Some examples of the information analyzed in this project are: 
-  Net Income
-  Revenue
-  Time (in weeks)
-  Cups Sold
-  Customer Satisfaction
-  Cup Size

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Project Walk Through

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Source ###
> For this project, our data comes from a business simulation called Biz Cafe. Over the past few weeks, we (the class and I) were given the chance to create a virtual coffee shop in class were we would have to navigate through various decisions that would either hurt or benefit our business. And over the course of this time, the following data was collected: revenue, customer satisfaction, small/medium/large cups sold, and net income (as seen in the screen capture below).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization #1: Net Income vs. Revenue ###
>The first visualizaiton compares my company's, Stir Sunrise, Net Income to Revenue. As you can see from the screen capture below, even though the net income is quite high for a beginning business like Stir Sunrise, the revenue is much, much higher. It's through data like this we can see how expensive it is to run a business. From salaries, to rent, to purchases, to unexpected costs, businesses can be quite costly even for a person who starts their business off on the right foot. One mistake (or in this case, as it was a virtual simulation, one wrong decision) and your business can fly off the market. Thus, if you're a real business owner or an owner of a virtual coffee shop (like I was in this scenario) it's always important to pay attention to your businesse's data like revenue or net income, because more likely or not your business if trying to tell you something and all you have to do is listen.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization #2: Time vs. Cups Sold  ###
>Next, in visualization #2, I wanted to get a better understanding where all of this revenue is coming from. To see this, I dove into my coffee shops main and only selling product: coffee. Specifically, the three types or better yet sizes offered at Stir Sunrise: small, medium, and large. For this visualization (seen in the screen capture below) we can tell, right off the bat, that in comparison to the small or large cups of coffee, the medium cups of coffee sold out the most.The reason for this could be because the medium cups of coffee were the first cups of coffee offered by the coffee shop, therefore getting a head start in sales, but it can also be because of the perfect price the medium cup was offered at in comparison to other coffee shops on the virtual simulation market. If this is true, it would also makes sense why the small cups of coffee follow the medium cups of coffee in cups sold as the small cups of coffee, at Stir Sunrise, were offered very cheap and even below market average (thus, making customers more willing to buy this size of drink). The largest cup, however trailed in last place having the least amount of sales: the larger the cup, the larger the price tag, and hence less people willing to buy that size. This data analysis is praticularly important for a business owner as it shows what coffee your customers are more willing to buy and thus what you should focus on to bring more customer satisfaction (as customer satisfaction is key to any business).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization #3: Customer Satisfaction by Coffee Shop ###
>Speaking of customer satisfaction, for my third and final visualization, I decided to compare customer satisfaction across all the other coffee shops on the virtual simulation market. Each coffee shop was ranked from a scale of 0 to 100: 0 being a pretty bad coffee shop and 100 being a fantastic coffee shop. These ranks were created based on different factors including: survey results left by customers, responsiveness to coffee quality, costs, and many more. From the information provided in the screen capture below we can see that out of all the coffee shops on the virtual market, "Hideout" had the highest customer satisfaction score at 80.80. My coffee shop, "Stir Sunrise", also ranked pretty high at 63.10 which is number 5 of virtual coffee shops, ranked by customer satisfaction. By doing this analysis we get to see a full picture of where different coffee lovers go for their coffee of choice. This is important as it highlights your competitors on the market and what you, as a business owner, could do to achieve that level of customer satisfaction. Essentially, this type of anylsis allows you to reflect on the current position you are in the market and what you and your business can do to get better.
